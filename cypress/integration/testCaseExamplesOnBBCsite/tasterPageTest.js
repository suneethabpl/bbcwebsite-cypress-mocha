        //takes a request of one,two and give it to the cypress to ececute. 
        //bascically,it's node.js process which is single thread which takes all the request at once
        //and pass it to the processors executor and then come back takes another request.
        //  console.log('I am inside') is inside of cypress, it is in queue, then cypress executes
        //one by one. cypress will first open the application and then it executes to get teh h1 tag.
        //and then try to print that one in console command log and then it also giving output.

        //text() method is not a cypress method. it is jquery method. that's why we put .then to resolve
        //the promise and once the promises resolved then take the result. on the top of teh result,
        //whatever is the promises returned that's a yield subject. on the top of it, apply text method to get the text of it.
